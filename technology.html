							<p>Perception is the foundation of reasoning and actions. It starts with low-level model-free deep-learned perceptual modules, which models the unconscious perception activities. A hierarchical model-based graph model is then stacked on top of the low-level modules, forming a structure of high-level explainable intermediate representation. Such high-level presentation accounts for the explicit perceptual activities, which is the root of the higher-level reasoning.</p>
							<p>The ability to reason about the hidden states is a key component in our method. The hierarchical structure with explicit representation of the perceived world, our method is capable to deductively and inductively learn the hidden states of the world, filling the gap between the perceived states and the ground truth states. Such deep understanding of the world’s states lays the groundwork for generating proper actions.</p>
